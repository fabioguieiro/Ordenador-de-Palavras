a young graduate student called Richard Watson sat down to read a paper 
on evolution The article was provocative It tackled a running problem in 
evolutionary biology we do not fully understand how organisms can adapt 
so successfully to their environments
Creatures do not seem to be merely at the mercy of random changes or 
mutations in their genes over time. Instead they actually seem to improve
 their ability to adapt It seemed this ability was not explained solely by
 the process of natural selection in which the best traits are passed on by
 the most successful organisms
So the papers authors Gunter Wagner at Yale University and Lee Altenberg at 
the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology in Honolulu decided to look
 for answers in a surprising place computer science
Watson, a computer scientist was hooked In the years since he read that paper he 
has been developing a theory based on the ideas it contained  His ideas could help
 explain why animals are so good at evolving  a trait called their evolvability What's
 more it might even help to solve some long running curiosities in evolutionary biology
 step from the road to the sea to the sky really
